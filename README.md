# UNIX Shell

A shell is a terminal-like environment that accepts commands from a user. 
This UNIX shell is a particular version that is designed for the Linux operating system. 
Below are some examples of functionality that my implementation in C supports:

```
exit         - terminates the shell process
pid          - shell prints its process ID
ppid         - shell prints the process ID of its parent
cd <dir>     - change the working directory of the shell process
pwd          - prints the current working directory
```

The shell also supports various background processes such as ```ls``` or ```sleep```.
